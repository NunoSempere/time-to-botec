This is a version of time-to-botec for nim for which I define logarithms, normals & lognormals pretty much 
from scratch, without relying on libraries except for random numbers, sqrts, or taking a to the power of b.

This is interesting because it leads to better understanding. But it doesn't help compare the efficiency of various languages. So I'm setting it aside for now, even though I think it was really interesting.
